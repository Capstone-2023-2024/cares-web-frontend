# This is a React development to be port in react-native

# Changelog:

- Action buttons(`resolved` and `turn-over`) are now added
- UI Updated, moved class mates into student follow-up set-up for reference in various student ids
- removed unnecessary components in development
- `student` and `mayor` flow done.

# Issues:

- (`student`/`mayor`)'s new complaint UI is not reflected in Complaint box, check line 605
- `student`'s turn-overed complaints are not reflecting in Complaints and the adviser is not available
